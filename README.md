# .dotfiles

My personal dot files and configs (including Vim, Fish, i3-gaps, polybar, termite and so on)

![My Rice](./rice.png)

## Installation guide

* git clone the repository (if you're going to use vim plugins, you might want to clone it recursively)
* cd into the folder
* copy configs from `.config/` to your `$HOME/.config` (`~/.config`) config directory

## Notes

* rename/delete **/usr/bin/i3-migrate-config-to-v4** in order to get i3-wm work with sxhkd bindings
* if going to grab all the configs, do the first three steps of [Installation](https://github.com/dakyskye/dotfiles/#installation-guide) and `cp -r .config/* $HOME/.config/`
* copy [etc/systemd/system/sy.service](https://github.com/dakyskye/dotfiles/tree/master/etc/system/systemd/sy.service) to your `/etc/systemd/systemd` and execute `systemctl enable sy` with root privileges to update the pacman database on system startup
* [.packages_pacman](https://github.com/dakyskye/dotfiles/tree/master/.packages_pacman) and [.packages_aur](https://github.com/dakyskye/dotfiles/tree/master/.packages_aur) contain the installed packages from native and foreign (in my case, AUR) databases, generated by [packages.sh](https://github.com/dakyskye/dotfiles/tree/master/packages.sh) script


## Some configs which I do not use anymore nowadays, lays in legacy branch!

Check [legacy](https://github.com/dakyskye/dotfiles/tree/legacy) branch out, you might find some config, which I no more use nowadays, useful!
